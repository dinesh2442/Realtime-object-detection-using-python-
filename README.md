# Realtime-object-detection-using-python-opencv
Real-time object detection is a powerful application of computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects within video streams or images as they are captured. This project uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) in Python to achieve real-time object detection, which can be useful in various applications such as surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and interactive applications.
